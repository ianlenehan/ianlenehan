### Hi! Ian here. 👋 
I'm a Senior Frontend Developer currently working at <a href="https://www.ignitionapp.com" target="_blank">Ignition</a>. I've been lucky enough to also work for <a href="https://readingeggs.co.uk/about-blake/" target="_blank">Blake Education</a>, <a href="https://www.yarno.com.au/" target="_blank">Yarno</a> and briefly <a href="https://8x8.com/" target="_blank">8x8</a>.

I live in London 🇬🇧 these days but I work for an Australian 🇦🇺 company in the Canadian 🇨🇦 dev team, so I guess you could say my job is as remote as it comes. 😃

I've worked mostly Frontend since I fell in love with coding at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>, but I have played with some backend technologies over the years, including Ruby on Rails, Node, and dabbled in AWS and Google Cloud.

Here's some of the stuff I'm working on in my own time:

- 🏊 <a href="https://www.neptunecrm.com" target="_blank">Neptune CRM</a>: Developed for a pool sales business, I've designed and built this from the ground up with Create React App, Google Cloud, Firebase, Github Actions, Cypress testing and more cool stuff. The repo is private at the moment though, sorry 🔐
- 📱 Cure8 is a React Native app I developed that allows you to curate and archive content you find on the web for yourself and your friends. This was available on both the iOS and Google Play app stores but I am working on a V2 so hope to get it back there soon.
- ⛳ Partown is a fun little React Native app I developed for me and my friends so we could keep a track of winners and... non-winners in our weekly golf competitions.

There's so much to learn in this industry and I wish there was more time in the day to build more and learn more. I enjoy sharing my knowledge through mentoring at General Assembly and running intro to code workshops at the places I work. I've also recently started a <a href="https://youtube.com./ianlenehan/" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> which is a good way for me to keep learning more and to share what I have learned with others.

You'll find more information over at <a href="https://www.ianlenehan.com" target="_blank">my website</a> or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilenehan/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>.
